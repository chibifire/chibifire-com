  <description>V-Sekai is a small group of developers and VR enthusiasts who felt there was a need for an open-source ecosystem focused on VR. We believe social VR should be a truly community-driven experience. For this to be realised, we believe the entire software stack should be available, moddable, and tweakable from the source up, which is why a lot of our projects focus on the MIT-Licensed Godot Engine</description>
